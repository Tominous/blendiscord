## FAQs
### It's hanging when I exit Discord/Blender or open it without Discord!
I know, I haven't implemented handling for exiting or opening yet but it's one of my top priorities on this right now.
Be patient, this will be fixed soon.
### The Enable Rich Presence checkbox doesn't do anything!
Yes, I know that too, I'm going to add functionality for that very soon.
This is a beta, some features are not yet complete.
